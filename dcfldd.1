.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dcfldd
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Copy a file, converting and formatting according to the options.
.PP
bs=BYTES             force ibs=BYTES and obs=BYTES
cbs=BYTES            convert BYTES bytes at a time
conv=KEYWORDS        convert the file as per the comma separated keyword list
count=BLOCKS         copy only BLOCKS input blocks
ibs=BYTES            read BYTES bytes at a time
if=FILE              read from FILE instead of stdin
obs=BYTES            write BYTES bytes at a time
of=FILE              write to FILE instead of stdout
seek=BLOCKS          skip BLOCKS obs\-sized blocks at start of output
skip=BLOCKS          skip BLOCKS ibs\-sized blocks at start of input
pattern=BYTES        use the specified binary pattern as input
textpattern=TEXT     use repeating TEXT as input
hashwindow=BYTES     perform a hash on every BYTES amount of data
hashalgorithm=NAME   either MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384 or SHA512
.IP
default algorithm is MD5
.PP
hashlog=FILE         send MD5 hash output to FILE instead of stderr
status=[on|off]      display a continual status message on stderr
.IP
default state is "on"
.PP
sizeprobe=[if|of]    determine the size of the input or output file
.IP
for use with status messages. (this option
gives you a percentage indicator)
WARNING: Read the manual before using this
.IP
option.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
BLOCKS and BYTES may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes:
xM M, c 1, w 2, b 512, kD 1000, k 1024, MD 1,000,000, M 1,048,576,
GD 1,000,000,000, G 1,073,741,824, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.
Each KEYWORD may be:
.PP
ascii     from EBCDIC to ASCII
ebcdic    from ASCII to EBCDIC
ibm       from ASCII to alternated EBCDIC
block     pad newline\-terminated records with spaces to cbs\-size
unblock   replace trailing spaces in cbs\-size records with newline
lcase     change upper case to lower case
notrunc   do not truncate the output file
ucase     change lower case to upper case
swab      swap every pair of input bytes
noerror   continue after read errors
sync      pad every input block with NULs to ibs\-size; when used
.IP
with block or unblock, pad with spaces rather than NULs
